    "There will be opportunities for generating wealth, maybe in the form of second income or good investment yields, yet do ensure you don't get too carried away. Adopt a rational approach with realistic expectations. Giving your time to a charity boosts your luck and spiritual karma. Be kind and compassionate, always lending a helping hand and reaching out to those who may be in need.",

    <br />,
    "Focus on sound financial planning, while taking good care of your health. Maintain harmony for sustained luck. Your mixture of stars in your chart indicates success, fame and personal growth, which can only surface if you can quell any unnecessary expenditure and conflict. Maintain good health and treat any unusual illness early, especially during your weaker months. Think long and hard before making any major decisions.",
  ],
  ox: "A year of new opportunities awaits as your situation changes to your highest good. Self-investment pays off big time, so if there is something you have been planning to do, then the Snake (your astrological friend) will do all within its power to point you in the right direction for steady progress. Just do be careful when travelling to prevent loss of personal items and minor accidents. Love is in the air for many Oxen this year and friendships will play an important factor in 2025. Although you have a low astrological ranking, maintain your optimism and a strong mindset: accept any challenges to receive long-term benefits. Travel helps prevent a few curve balls hitting you. As you are affected by the energy of Wu Wang, double check everything before signing any documents. It pays to play your cards close to the chest for much of the year, especially during your weaker months.",
  tiger:
    "While wealth will not be lacking, you will benefit from watching your own back against any unscrupulous individuals, scams and those who may have an ulterior motive. Be cautious against injuries and mishaps as your energy may be distracted. You may feel emotional and at times isolated, unable to be in your usual decisive mindset. This is not the best year to begin any new business as you share the same astrological location as the Ox. In addition, you are considered to be affected by the energy of Wu Wang, being the nemesis of the Snake's bestie, the Monkey. Be on guard against any setbacks to your plans and during any forms of travel, especially driving and during your weaker months.",
  rabbit:
    "You may look forward to some new opportunities supported by strong benefactor luck. Past efforts harness positive financial support with the potential for a salary increase or an unexpected bonus. Travel boosts luck and opportunities in 2025. In fact, keep a bag always packed as there may be many last-minute trips; you will thrive on the spontaneity of the energy of the Snake. There may be a major relocation lined up, which you may have been planning for a while - if so, this year is very timely for you to make any major breaks with the past and embrace change. Be careful with any home improvements, especially if working from any height. Also be careful of any water-related injuries. Harmony will be key to your luck potential, so do ensure you maintain good interpersonal relationships as well as keeping within all legal boundaries. Make sure you do not attract the wrong type of attention in 2025, as you have some troublesome energy hanging over you, which could catch you out during your weaker months.",
  dragon:
    "A year of recovery and a very fulfilling year awaits many Dragons, where you will be relieved of your responsibilities and can step down, handing over the baton to your astrological neighbour and friend, the Snake. This appears to be a sociable year, and the more you are willing to be seen and heard, the better. Maintain your good reputation by surrounding yourself with those you know well and who have your back. Communication will be important to establishing new contacts for future projects. As you navigate your way through a prosperous year, you may spend a considerable amount on travel. This will prove to be a good investment for your future progress, due to the support of two auspicious stars.",
  snake:
    "It's your year. You have a positive star landing in your chart, which offers you fame and fortune. You are popular and as such the light is shining on you and everything you do, so make sure you maintain good personal boundaries, as the last thing you need is bad press in such a positive year. Be diligent in your decision making, take your time and always deliver only the best of yourself in every situation. You'll enjoy strong career luck, which could result in a step up in the 2025 game of snakes and ladders. Do maintain a legal stance, though, so as not to jeopardise your luck. Be cautious about being scammed and or disappointed by certain friends. It is also advised that you visit the temple to receive blessings and protection as you are deemed to be offending the god of the year, aka Tai Sui. Shedding a little blood such as by having your teeth cleaned before the end of April is a form of self-protection against accidents and injuries, especially during your weaker months.",
  horse:
    "Horses may look forward to a stellar year ahead: the prosperity star lands in the South, which is your astrological location. Focus on new job ventures and anything that involves movement and travel. There will be new avenues of product lines to promote so make sure your investments are sound, with good reliable sources. Treat others well, and you will receive an equal amount of trust and support. Be willing to step up to the podium and come out a winner in 2025 as you have the luck to come first. This will be a high vibration year, affording you a positive mindset. With such a busy year, do be careful as you will be trotting your way through 2025. Be mindful to avoid burnout and fatigue, especially if you find yourself on any long-haul flights. Take your time when making important and long-term decisions.",
  goat: "This year promotes self-investment, upskilling and being willing to embrace a change of direction. Diligence brings rewards: even though you are not in the highest luck ranking in 2025, your luck is within your own hands, which sometimes is just the way you like it. Keeping emotions in check goes a long way to self-support and boost your luck. Seek support if needed, as helping hands are available and more than willing to assist you in any way. Strengthen your communication and don't hold back if any air needs clearing. Think things through and be willing to take advice available to you before making major decisions, otherwise the luck available to you could dissolve. Travel improves your luck. Look after any ailing family member.",
  monkey:
    "Your luck remains in your dexterous hands in 2025. The difference between 2024 and 2025 is that you have wealth luck on your side, provided you invest in the right product(s) and with the right people. You may be considering closing some deals and going through some form of consolidation, truly shedding skins and projects that may have outlived their usefulness. The Snake is your astrological bestie and will have your back, so trust your instinct as you enjoy a great sense of timing together. Focus on widening your social circle and enjoying travel opportunities that may come your way, especially towards a south/southwest direction from your original location. Be willing to be transparent in all communications. Maintain your focus and motivation, as much will be expected of you by many. You must know when to withdraw to protect yourself from ill advice, as for many born in the Years of the Monkey, this may be a year for life changes and relocations. Your decisions in 2025 will be important to the next phase of your life, so make sure you make the right ones by listening to your heart. It is also advised that you visit the temple to receive blessings and protection as you are deemed to be offending the god of the year, aka Tai Sui. Shedding a little blood such as by having your teeth cleaned before the end of April is a form of self- protection against accidents and injuries.",
  rooster:
    "Roosters draw on the energy of the Snake, it being one of their astrological best friends, enhancing all aspects to create recognition and rewards from past efforts and diligence. Your wealth luck is strong, and many will be keen to invest in you and your abilities for personal growth and expansion. This really is a great year to make changes, relocate and/or benefit from being in the right place at the right time. There may be increased opportunities for travel for both work and pleasure. When life picks up the pace, it is easy to mentally match its speed, so do be careful as a pedestrian and when driving. This may be an expensive year, but you will also have financial support to draw on. As in 2024, continue to make health a priority. Remember that you can only help others fully from a full cup, so look after your health during weaker months.",
  dog: "After a challenging astrological clash in 2024, you may emerge from your kennel triumphant and ready to find a new and loyal master, in the form of a new career position or partnership that puts you more on an equal footing. If you find yourself being challenged by a lawsuit or anything of a legal nature, take heart, as you will most probably emerge the victor. You have several lucky stars in your chart, which help quell any ill luck of the past year. These will attract some rather nice people who admire you and your principles. Be cautious about communications with certain individuals, especially those closest to you who may have shown their true colours. It may be time to step away and change direction. It's time for positive changes in all aspects of your life - love is in the air.",
  pig: "As you are the Snake's nemesis, this may be a challenging year after a good run of luck since 2023. Think things through and be willing to take advice available to you before making major decisions, otherwise the luck available to you could dissolve. You may feel impatient and edgy with many in 2025, however avoid getting too entangled in other issues as you may end up left out of some potentially good deals. Avoid being stubborn and be willing to eat a little humble pie, as this will go a long way to dispelling some uncomfortable moments. It is also advised that you visit the temple to receive blessings and protection as you are deemed to be offending the god of the year, aka Tai Sui. Shedding a little blood such as by having your teeth cleaned before the end of April is a form of self-protection against accidents and injuries. Be charitable and kind to seek greater spiritual support.",
